Mac OS X Build Instructions
===========================

The Easy Way:
-------------

Atomic Labs has a tarball available from the "Third Party Libraries"
page on our website that contains all of the required libraries to
build Pion, with support for both 32-bit and 64-bit Intel and PowerPC 
architectures.  To get started quickly, just download and uncompress
this into your /usr/local/ directory, and you should be able to skip
down to one of the last two steps!


Installing Boost on OSX:
------------------------

Please see the README.boost file for general instructions.

To build Universal binaries for OSX, you need to first patch boost to 
support a new "32_64" address model (still required as of version 1.37):

# cd <boost-source>/tools/build/v2/tools
# patch -p0 < <pion-source>/common/build/32_64.diff

(this patch is from https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/1679)

The bjam command to build Universal binaries for all libraries is:

# bjam --toolset=darwin debug release threading=multi architecture=combined \
	address-model=32_64 stage
	
To build 64-bit binaries, run Pion's configure script with 
"--with-arch=x86_64 --with-cpu=nocona".  Please note that Pion's unit 
tests currently fail when using 64-bit binaries on OSX due to 
compatibility bugs in Boost's unit test framework.


Installing zlib, bzlib & openssl:
---------------------------------

Pion requires zlib, bzlib and openssl for compression and SSL/TLS encryption
support, respectively.  These libraries are normally pre-installed on
OS X.  If you do not have them already, you should be able to grab the
latest source code tarballs from the "Third Party Libraries" page on
our website, or from the following sites:

http://www.zlib.net
http://www.bzip.org
http://www.openssl.org


Logging frameworks:
-------------------

Note that the use of a logging framework is entirely optional, so you may
skip this step if you like.

We recommend that you use log4cxx for logging.  Log4cxx requires that 
you have the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) installed.  This library is 
normally pre-installed on OS X (make sure that you have "libapr" and
"libapr-util" dynamic libraries within /usr/lib).

If you do not have APR pre-installed, you should be able to grab the
latest source code tarballs from the "Third Party Libraries" page on
our website, or from the following site:

http://apr.apache.org

Please visit the "Third Party Libraries" page on our website to obtain
the source code tarball for log4cxx.  Then, just run:

# tar xvfj log4cxx-<version>.tar.bz2
# cd log4cxx-<version>
# ./configure
# make all
# make install

For Universal binaries, use:

# CXXFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" ./configure \
	--disable-dependency-tracking


Installing libxml2:
-------------------

The Pion Platform requires the libxml2 development library for 
manipulating configuration files, and other things.  This library is not 
used by the Pion Network Library, so you may skip this step if you are 
only building the Network Library.

The libxml2 library is normally pre-installed on OS X.  If you do not 
have it already, you should be able to grab the latest source code
tarball from the "Third Party Libraries" page on our website, or from
the following site:

http://www.xmlsoft.org


Installing OSSP uuid:
---------------------

The Pion Platform requires the OSSP uuid library to generate universally 
unique identifiers for most platforms, including OS X.  This library is 
not used by the Pion Network Library, so you may skip this step if you 
are only building the Network Library.

You can download the source code tarball for the uuid library from the 
"Third Party Libraries" page on our website.  After downloading it, just 
run:

# tar xvfz uuid-<version>.tar.gz
# cd uuid-<version>
# ./configure
# make all
# make install

For Universal binaries, use:

# LDFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
	CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" ./configure

This will build a Universal static library, but the dynamic library will be
broken and the final linking of the uuid executable will fail.  Just copy
the necessary files manually into your /usr/local directories:

# cp .libs/libuuid.a /usr/local/lib
# cp uuid.h /usr/local/include
# cp uuid-config /usr/local/bin


Installing SQLite:
------------------

SQLite version 3 is required to build support for the embedded database
(the SQLiteDatabase plugin).  You may skip this step if you do not want
to build support for the embedded database.

The SQLite library is normally pre-installed on OS X.  If you do not 
have it already, you should be able to grab the latest source code
tarball from the "Third Party Libraries" page on our website, or from
the following site:

http://www.sqlite.org


Installing YAJL:
----------------

YAJL ("Yet Another JSON Library") is required to build support for the
JSONCodec plugin.  You may skip this step if you do not want to build
support for JSON.

To build YAJL, you must first have CMake installed on your system.  You
can download the source tarball for CMake from the "Third Party
Libraries" page on our website, or from the following site:

http://cmake.org

You can download the source code tarball for YAJL from the "Third Party
Libraries" page on our website.  After downloading it, just run:

# tar xvfz yajl-<version>.tgz
# cd yajl-<version>
# ./configure
# make

Note: to build universal libraries, edit the CMakeLists.txt file before
running "./configure" and change this line:

SET(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -fPIC -ansi")

to this:

SET(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -fPIC -ansi -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64")

To install YAJL, we recommend that you just move the build files in the
"build/yajl-<version>" subdirectory into /usr/local:

# sudo mv build/yajl-<version>/lib/* /usr/local/lib
# sudo mv build/yajl-<version>/include/yajl /usr/local/include


Building and installing Pion:
-----------------------------

Now you should be able to build and install Pion:

# tar xvfz pion-<PROJECT>-<VERSION>.tar.gz
# cd pion-<PROJECT>-<VERSION>
# ./configure [--with-openssl] [--with-log4cxx] [--with-sqlite] \
	[--with-yajl] [--with-arch=x86_64] [--with-cpu=nocona]
# make all
# make install

To build and run Pion's unit tests, run "make check"


Building with XCode:
--------------------

There is an XCode project included in the root directory of each project
called "pion-<PROJECT>.xcodeproj".  The XCode project assumes that you have
the following optional libraries installed: openssl, zlib, log4cxx and
SQLite.  It also is configured to build a Universal binary with support for
the i386 and ppc architectures.  You must have built all the dependency
libraries with support for both architectures for this to work properly.
A tarball containing all of these built for both the 32-bit and 64-bit Intel
and PowerPC architectures is available on the "Third Party Libraries" on our
website.  Alternatively, you can just modify the XCode project config to
build only for your native architecture.

To run the Pion server from within XCode, you first need to configure
the executable's command arguments by right-clicking on "pion" under the
"Executables" group in the left menu, and selecting "Get Info."   Under
the "Arguments" tab, add the following argument:
"-c ../../platform/server/platform.xml" Next, set "pion" as the "Active
Target" and click on the "Build and Go" button.  Building "pion" will also
build all of the service, codec, database and reactor plug-ins.

To run PionWebServer from within XCode, you first need to configure
the executable's command arguments by right-clicking on PionWebServer
under the "Executables" group in the left menu, and selecting "Get Info." 
Under the "Arguments" tab, add the following argument:
"-c ../../net/utils/services.conf" Next, set PionWebServer as the
"Active Target" and click on the "Build and Go" button.  Building
PionWebServer will also build all of the service plug-ins.
