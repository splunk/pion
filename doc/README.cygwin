Cygwin/GNU C++ Build Instructions
=================================

For building under Windows, only the Cygwin/GNU C++ compiler (g++) and
Microsoft's Visual C++ 2005 compiler are currently supported. We plan to add
support for the MinGW compiler in the near future. Please see README.msvc for
instructions on using Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler.


Installing Cygwin Packages:
---------------------------

In order to configure pion-net, you will need to install the bash shell and
GNU make programs.  We recommend that you download and install the programs
included with Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com/.  The bash shell is included
by default; however, you will need to add the make package (it is located
within the "Devel" group).  For a complete development environment, we
recommend also installing the following Cygwin packages:

Archive: unzip zip
Devel: binutils autoconf automake gcc-g++ gdb libtool make openssl-devel 
       subversion
Editors: nano
Net: openssh
Perl: perl
Utils: patch
Web: wget


Building Boost with ASIO:
-------------------------

Please see the README.boost file for instructions.

Boost 1.34.0 has several bugs that prevent it from installing correctly
under Cygwin.  There is a patch that fixes all of these bugs called
"cygwin_boost_1_34_0.patch" within pion-net's doc subdirectory.  If you
are using Boost 1.34.0, make sure that you apply this patch after
uncompressing the Boost source code tarball:

patch -p0 < PION_NET_HOME/doc/cygwin_boost_1_34_0.patch

This file includes fixes for the following tickets in Boost's Trac
database: 966, 1025, and 1062.  The patches for 966 and 1025 were
included in the 1.34.1 release, however 1062 was not.  So, if you are
using Boost 1.34.1, apply the "cygwin_boost_1_34_1.patch" instead:

patch -p0 < PION_NET_HOME/doc/cygwin_boost_1_34_1.patch

There's one more bug in 1.34.0 AND 1.34.1 that you need to fix after
building and installing the Boost libraries (see Boost Trac ticket
1058).  Boost names the "import" libraries using a format that is
incompatable with GNU's libtool (they use the format "boost_*.dll.a"
instead of "libboost_*.dll.a").  You can fix this by creating symbolic
links for the libraries needed by pion-net:

cd BOOST_INSTALL_DIR/lib
ln -s boost_thread-gcc34-mt.dll.a libboost_thread-gcc34-mt.dll.a
ln -s boost_system-gcc34-mt.dll.a libboost_system-gcc34-mt.dll.a
ln -s boost_filesystem-gcc34-mt.dll.a libboost_filesystem-gcc34-mt.dll.a
ln -s boost_regex-gcc34-mt.dll.a libboost_regex-gcc34-mt.dll.a
ln -s boost_date_time-gcc34-mt.dll.a libboost_date_time-gcc34-mt.dll.a
ln -s boost_unit_test_framekwork-gcc34-mt.dll.a libboost_unit_test_framework-gcc34-mt.dll.a

These patches may be unnecessary for Boost 1.34.2 and later releases.


Installing zlib & openssl:
--------------------------

ASIO requires zlib and openssl for compression and SSL/TLS encryption
support, respectively.  On Windows, we recommend that you use Cygwin to
install these libraries. However, you may instead choose to download and
install the latest versions from the following sites:

http://www.zlib.net
http://www.openssl.org


Logging frameworks:
-------------------

Note that the use of a logging framework is entirely optional, so you may
skip this step if you like.

At this time, none of the supported logging libraries build correctly
under Windows.  If you'd like to help add support for these, you can
download the current source code from the following sites:

http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx
http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net
http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net


Building and installing pion-net:
---------------------------------

Now you should be able to build and install pion-net:
(the "-D_WIN32_WINNT=0x500" eliminates warnings in ASIO)

tar xvfz pion-net-VERSION.tar.gz
cd pion-net-VERSION
CPPFLAGS="-D_WIN32_WINNT=0x500" \
	./configure --with-boost=/usr/local [--with-openssl]
make ; make install


Known Problems:
---------------

The POSIX path emulation layer provided by cygwin sometimes confused the
boost::filesystem library.  pion-net includes some extra code for cygwin to
try to find the path you actually want.  If you are using pion-net in a
cygwin environment, you may need to configure your cygwin installation
directory using the parameter "--with-cygwin=[directory]" (the default is
"c:/cygwin").  Please see the boost::filesystem documenation for more
information: http://www.boost.org/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm

If Windows cannot find all the shared libraries used by your program, it will
simply exit immediately without printing any messages.  To see what shared
libraries (or DLLs) a program uses, you can use the following command:

objdump -p <PROGRAM> | grep "DLL Name"

You may want to make sure that your executables can find the Boost DLLs
located in "lib" subdirectory of your installation path by adding the
directory to your PATH:

export PATH=/usr/local/lib:$PATH

(assuming that you are using the default prefix of /usr/local/lib)
